<h3>Description</h3>
<p>I recently came up with a copycat pumpkin cream cold brew.
I liked it so much I tried making it with a different flavor. This worked out deliciously.</p>

<h3>Ingredeints</h3>
<ul>
    <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sugar-free peanut butter-flavored syrup (such as Torani®)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon powdered peanut butter (such as PB2®)</li>
    <li>ice</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar-free vanilla syrup (such as Torani®)</li>
    <li>1 cup cold brew coffee, or as needed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Direction for the Ingredeints</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Combine heavy whipping cream, syrup, peanut butter, and powdered peanut butter in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Whip with a hand mixer until creamy and slightly thickened.</li>
    <li>Fill 2 glasses with ice. Add 1 tablespoon vanilla syrup to each glass</li>
    <li>Fill 2/3 of the way with cold brew coffee, and divide peanut butter cream evenly between both.</li>
    </ol>
